cryptographic tools) in [JavaScript][].

This repository is used to hold pre-built bundles of the [Forge][] library for
use with [NPM][] or other tools. 

Please use the main [Forge][] project if you wish to build your own full or
custom bundles, use un-minimized sources, or require full sourcemaps.

Please see the main [Forge][] site for library documentation, installation
instructions, details on building custom bundles, and to file issues.
